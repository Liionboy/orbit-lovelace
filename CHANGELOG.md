# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- Update Welcome Orbit to v1.1.0: opt-in `layout: compact`, collapsible quick navigation, top weather/date chip and optional explicit `settings_path`.
- `shortcuts_expanded` sets the initial panel state; existing 0–8 shortcut paths/scenes, names/icons and guards retained. Classic is still the default.
- Update the suite in HACS, fully reload, select Header layout → compact in Welcome and configure your routes/weather. No new standalone resource required.
- All other component pins, including Weather v1.2.0, are unchanged.

## 1.2.0

- Update Weather Orbit to v1.2.0, adding an optional measured outdoor sensor separate from the weather provider. Select Outdoor temperature sensor in the editor or set `outdoor_temperature_entity`.
- Own units and precision, zero/negative values and independent availability are retained. No sensor auto-discovery, forecast substitution, new sensor queries or commands.
- Exact selected sensor More Info; missing/unavailable values are explicit. Existing clock/date, forecast, types and single suite resource stay compatible.
- Other component pins remain unchanged. Update Orbit Lovelace in HACS, fully reload the frontend, then select your outdoor sensor.
